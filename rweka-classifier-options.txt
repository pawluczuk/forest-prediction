	Number of arguments: 1.
-doNotMakeSplitPointActualValue
        Do not make split point actual value.
-output-debug-info
        If set, classifier is run in debug mode and may output additional info to the console
-do-not-check-capabilities
        If set, classifier capabilities are not checked before classifier is built (use with caution).
-num-decimal-places
        The number of decimal places for the output of numbers in the model (default 2).
	Number of arguments: 1.
-batch-size
        The desired batch size for batch prediction (default 100).

WOW("IBk")
-I      Weight neighbours by the inverse of their distance (use when k > 1)
-F      Weight neighbours by 1 - their distance (use when k > 1)
-K <number of neighbors>
        Number of nearest neighbours (k) used in classification.  (Default = 1)
        Number of arguments: 1.
-E      Minimise mean squared error rather than mean absolute error when using -X option with numeric
